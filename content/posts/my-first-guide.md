## Why I chose Render
Render is a great low-cost option for hosting static sites like this one...
Prompt: "I have a local Hugo project ready. Act as a DevOps Engineer and guide me through pushing this to a new GitHub repository and deploying it to Render. Specifically, tell me the exact 'Build Command' and 'Publish Directory' required in the Render dashboard for a Hugo site to ensure the build doesn't fail."
