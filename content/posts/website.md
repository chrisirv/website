### What is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a fast static site generator. Unlike WordPress, which builds pages every time a visitor clicks a link, Hugo builds your entire website **once** into simple HTML files. This makes your site incredibly fast and more difficult to hack.

#### Why it’s a good choice:

- **$0 Hosting:** Because the files are static, you can host them for free on platforms like Render, GitHub Pages, or Netlify.
- **Extreme Speed:** Hugo can build 5,000 pages in less than 6 seconds.
- **No Databases:** You don't need to manage MySQL or worry about database connection errors.
- **Security:** There is no "backend" for hackers to log into. Your site is just a collection of pre-made files.
