### What is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is the world’s fastest static site generator. Unlike WordPress, which builds pages every time a visitor clicks a link, Hugo builds your entire website **once** into simple HTML files. This makes your site incredibly fast and nearly impossible to hack.

#### Why it’s the best choice (and free):

- **$0 Hosting:** Because the files are static, you can host them for free on platforms like Render, GitHub Pages, or Netlify.
- **Extreme Speed:** Hugo can build 5,000 pages in less than 6 seconds.
- **No Databases:** You don't need to manage MySQL or worry about database connection errors.
- **Security:** There is no "backend" for hackers to log into. Your site is just a collection of pre-made files.

### The Benefits of PaperMod:

Since you are using the **PaperMod** theme, you get professional features out of the box:
- **Dark Mode:** A toggle is built-in by default.
- **SEO Optimized:** Proper heading tags and lightning-fast load times for Google rankings.
- **Clean Aesthetic:** A minimalist, "tech-focused" look that works for portfolios and blogs alike.
